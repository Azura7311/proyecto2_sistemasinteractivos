Sistemas interactivos' 2° Project
Laura Sofía Lozano Díaz

This is a game made with console as interface and some sound effects using the OpenAl library for Python.
To execute it, you must install PyOpenAl: pip install pyopenal

The sounds were divided in two types: ambient for music and usually non diegetic (except the rain and the snores) and sfx for diegetic effects.

Due to the audio files size, they are uploaded in this drive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TBezFGbuH6Z9JqaobdtNHzvmSO_6C0Av/view?usp=sharing
